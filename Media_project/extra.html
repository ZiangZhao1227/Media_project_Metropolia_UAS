    <h2>Answers for Mr.Jack's studio:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The window is open, so there is light and sound from outside. It would be better to close the window and cover it with a curtain.</li>
        <li>Mp3 format is lossy, so he should record with WAV format since it's lossless.</li>
        <li>Camera microphone is not good at recording sound, so it would be better to use a professional microphone.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Answers for Mr.John's studio</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There is not enough light in the room, so to improve he needs good lightning.</li>
        <li>The air conditioning should be switched off since it might be noisy, which would affect the quality of his videos. </li>
        <li>His backgound enviroment is not very pleasing to the eye, he should decorate it by adding plants or some colorful lighting, for example.</li>
    </ul>
